        <p>This is for testing only, do not use it if you want something real to happen.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a href="/v1/search">Version 1 - shown to agents by Business Analyst and Product Support as an initial prototype</a></h2>
        
        <p>Interactions added:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>find a record</li>
          <li>view a record</li>
          <li>accept a registration</li>
          <li>change Disability Confident level, see level 1 commitments</li>
          <li>delete a record</li>
        </ul>

        <p><a class="govuk-button" href="/v1/search">Start - version 1</a></p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a href="/v2/sign-in">Version 2 - used with agents and team leaders in user research</a></h2>

        <p>Interactions added or updated:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">    
          <li>sign in, as only certain agents will be able to do the work</li>
          <li>view the list of registered employers</li>
          <li>see how many items are listed, as the team need to monitor volumes</li>
          <li>see what status items in the list have (eg through <a href="https://dwp-design-examples.herokuapp.com/example/tags">status tags</a>)</li>
          <li>send a confirmation email when an employer is accepted containing the information they need, eg through <a href="https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/using-notify">integration with Notify</a></li>
          <li>send a confirmation email when an employer is rejected containing the information they need, eg through <a href="https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/using-notify">integration with Notify</a></li>
          <li>indicate user can export employer records, as DC employers are reported on and published on GOV.UK</li>
          <li>show the approved date and expiry date (which will be 3 years after their approved date) for an approved company</li>
          <li>add prototype banner for user research purposes</li>
          <li>reject an employer registration</li>
          <li>organise the items in the list (there'll be over 10,000), eg through <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/77">pagination</a>
          <li>show record of actions taken against a record by agents, eg through the <a href="https://dwp-design-examples.herokuapp.com/example/timeline">timeline pattern</a> - which seems like it should sit under in the 'Case actions' section</li>
          <li>add way of changing other company details, eg contact name, address</li> 
          <li>update employer approved page so it reflects they are emailed automatically</li>
          <li>remove 'action needed' - was told that agents wish to handle this through Fresh Desk</li>
          <li>fix routing that's already been added for Disability Confident levels and the commitment pages these take the user to - something is stopping this taking effect</li>
        </ul>

        <p><a class="govuk-button" href="/v2/sign-in">Start - version 2</a></p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a href="/v3/email-new-registration">Version 3</a></h2>

        <p>Interactions added or updated:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">    
          <li>email at the start of the prototype indicates how agents will be alerted to new registrations</li>
          <li>list of companies includes company name, postcode, contact name, level, status, ID</li>
          <li>no ID in the list for new registrations, as they've not been accepted yet</li>
          <li>add 'change' links by details in company record</li>
          <li>add alert message above a new record to remind agent to check for duplicates, while they're in the context of looking at their details</li>
          <li>change 'confirm status' button to 'approve registration', as purpose was previously unclear</li>
          <li>add question about checking for duplicates as part of approval flow, as this is a check agents have to make</li>
          <li>add guidance page for where agent answered that the company is a duplicate - actions they need to take next</li>
          <li>add pages for agents to enter the company details above and beyond what they receive from the company as part of the 'approve' interaction before confirmation - selecting the matching jobcentre district after consulting FIND (the group matching the selection automatically), selecting the type of public sector employer they are if applicable</li>
          <li>add 'reject company' link to list of company actions, as the way to do this was previously unclear</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Interactions to add later:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>indicate change of details as they are made in the rest of the prototype</li>
          <li>how we present the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/133">list of records</a> (there are also examples in the <a href="https://github.com/dwp/design-examples/issues/5">DWP design patterns backlog</a>) - I've added a table for now</li>
          <li>find or concentrate on certain records, such as those that are pending, through <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/133">faceted search</a> or by <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/61">sorting the items</a></li>
          <li>resend certificate badge if company has lost their material</li>
          <li>example of a record for an expired employer, as a DC certificate can expire without them renewing it or asking to be removed from the scheme</li>
        </ul>
